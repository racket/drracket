`(#|

This directory contains code for testing DrScheme. To run the tests,
load run-test.ss. It will return a function that accepts the names of
tests. Those names must be listed here. If no arguments are passed to
the function, all tests will be run.


|# mem.ss #|

  runs some memory tests

|# sample-solutions.ss #|

   This tests the sample solutions in HtDP
   
|# io.ss #|

   This tests the drscheme's io implementation.
   
|# repl-test.ss #|

   This tests various interactions between parameters in the 
   implementation of drscheme.

|# language-test.ss #|   

   This tests that all of the individual settings in the language dialog 
   take effect in the repl.


|# graphics.ss #|

   This tests the various graphic elements that can appear
   in programs.

|# launcher.ss #|

   This tests the launcher feature of drscheme.

PR-based tests:
  
     pr-144.ss
     pr-17.ss
     pr-246.ss
     pr-39.ss
     pr-46.ss
     pr-48.ss
     pr-51.ss
     pr-58.ss
     pr-80.ss
     pr-99.ss 

Ideally, each test should be run with a fresh invocation
of DrScheme.  Since that's time-consuming, you can
run all tests by executing "drscheme-test.ss".

A small amount of manual intervention is needed during
the tests.  By intervention, we mean pushing buttons 
in dialogs that popup during the tests.

The progress and results of the tests are reported to
standard output.  You should examine this output to determine
whether if the tests were successful. 

The code is maintained by Paul Steckler.  The original code
was by Robby Findler.

There are some other files in this directory, which appear
to be unused, such as tmp.ss, and line-art.ss.  The directory
syncheck/ appears to be unused.
