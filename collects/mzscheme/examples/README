This directory contains a few example MzScheme extensions implemented
in C:

 * hello.c - returns the string "Hello, World!". Demonstrates creating
   a Scheme value.

 * fmod.c - defines the `fmod' procedure, which calculates modulo on
   floating-point numbers. Demonstrates creating Scheme procedures
   from C and adding top-level definitions.

 * curses.c - links MzScheme to the curses library. Demonstrates more
   procedures and definitions, a little more type dispatching, and
   returning multiple values.

 * makeadder.c - defines `make-adder', whch takes a number and returns
   a procedure that takes another number to add to it. Demonstrates
   closure creation in C, getting Scheme global values, and calling
   Scheme procedures from C.

 * bitmatrix.c - implements two-dimentional bit matrixes with some
   operations. Demonstrates defining a new Scheme data type, data
   allocation, fancy integer type checking, general exception raising,
   and registering static variables.

 * helloprint.c - prints "Hello, World!" directly to the current
   output port rather than relying on the read-eval-print-loop.
   Demonstrates using built-in Scheme parameter values from C.
