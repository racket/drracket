_SLaTeX_
========

The use SLaTeX as a standalone program, either drag your .tex file onto
SLaTeX (on the macintosh or windows), or type "slatex file" at the command
prompt (under windows or X).

Under the macintosh, SLaTeX will attempt to run OzTeX. If you do not have
OzTeX installed, or use another version of LaTeX, this will fail and you
can run your own version manually.

To use SLaTeX in a program, require _slatex.ss_:

  (require-library "slatex.ss" "slatex")

The file slatex.ss defines three procedures:

> (slatex filename)

This procedure accepts a string naming a file and runs slatex and latex on
the file. It calls `filename->latex-filename' on `filename'.

> (slatex/no-latex filename)

This procedure slatex's the file named by filename, without calling
latex. That is, it only processes the .tex file to produce the .Z files.
It calls filename->latex-filename on `filename'.

> (latex filename)

This procedure `latex's the file named by filename. It calls
filename->latex-filename on `filename'.

> (filename->latex-filename filename)

This procedure accepts a filename and, if that file exists, it returns
it. If the filename appended with the suffix `.tex' exists, that filename
is returned. Otherwise, error is called.
