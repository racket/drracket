@section{@onscreen{Edit}}

All @onscreen{Edit} menu items operate on either the definitions or
interactions window, depending on the location of the selection or
blinking caret. Each window maintains its own Undo and Redo history.

@itemize[

 @item{@defmenuitem{Undo} Reverses an editing action. Each window
  maintains a history of actions, so multiple @onscreen{Undo}
  operations can reverse multiple editing actions.}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Redo} Reverses an @onscreen{Undo} action. Each
  window (and boxed-subwindow) maintains its own history of
  @onscreen{Undo} actions, so multiple @onscreen{Redo} operations can
  reverse multiple @onscreen{Undo} actions.}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Cut} Copies the selected text to the clipboard and
  deletes it from the window.}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Copy} Copies the selected text to the clipboard.}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Paste} Pastes the current clipboard contents into the
  window.}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Paste and Indent} Pastes the current clipboard contents into the
  window and indents it, doing the same thing the tab key would do.}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Delete} or @defmenuitem{Clear} Deletes the selected text.}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Select All} Highlights the entire text of the buffer.}

  @item{@defmenuitem{Wrap Text} Toggles between wrapped text and
  unwrapped text in the window.}

 window at the bottom of the frame and moves the insertion
 point to the search string editor (or out of it, if the
 insertion point is already there).

 See also @secref["Searching"].}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Find From Selection}
        Just like @onscreen{Find}, except that it
        copies the current selection into the search
        window (but without using the clipboard, so
        paste will paste whatever was last copied,
        not the new search string)}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Find Next} Finds the next occurrence of the text 
 in the search window.}
  
 @item{@defmenuitem{Find Previous} Finds the next occurrence of the text 
 in the search window, but searching backwards.}
  
 @item{@defmenuitem{Show Replace}}

@item{@defmenuitem{Replace} Replaces the selection with the
  replace string (if it matches the find string) and finds the next
  occurrence of the text that was last searched for, looking forwards.}

@item{@defmenuitem{Replace All} Replaces all occurrences of
the search string with the replace string.}

@item{@defmenuitem{Find Case Sensitive} Toggles between
case-sensitive and case-insensitive search.}

  point to the longest line in the editor.}
  
@item{@defmenuitem{Keybindings}
@itemize[

@item{@defmenuitem{Show Active Keybindings} Shows all of the
  keybindings available in the current window.}

@item{@defmenuitem{Add User-defined Keybindings...} Choosing this menu
  item opens a file dialog where you can select a file containing

  for more information.}

       or @tt{ispell} to look for unknown words in string constants
       (things that would otherwise be colored green).}

       or @tt{ispell} to look for unknown words in Scribble text.}

@item{@defmenuitem{Skip to Next Misspelled Word} Sets the insertion
  point to the next word that is misspelled in the editor (if any).}

@item{@defmenuitem{Suggest Spelling Corrections...} Opens a window
  showing spelling corrections for the word at the insertion point.}

@item{@defmenuitem{Spelling Dictionaries} A submenu that lists all
       of the available spelling dictionaries.}

@item{@defmenuitem{Complete Word} Completes the word at the
insertion point, using the manuals as a source of completions.}

       Opens a separate window showing the module graph rooted at the
       file currently being edited in DrRacket, but
       using the saved file on the disk, instead of the 
       version in DrRacket.
       
  See also @secref["module-browser"].

        you've started editing but haven't yet sent in.}

 @item{@defmenuitem{Configure Command Line for Racket...} This menu item is
        available under Mac OS and Windows.

  On MacOS, after prompting you for your password, it adds a
  file named @filepath{racket} to @filepath{/etc/init.d/} that
  contains the location of the @filepath{bin} directory. This
  has the effect of adding that path to the default PATH
  environment variable (unless your shell explicitly changes
  the default behavior).

  On Windows, it changes the @tt{HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\Path}
  registry key to add the location of the @filepath{bin} directory.
  Once it finishes, newly created @tt{command.com} shells should have
  Racket in their path.
 }
  
 @item{@defmenuitem{Interact with DrRacket in English} Changes DrRacket's
   interface to use English; the menu item appears only when the
   current language is not English. Additional menu items switch
