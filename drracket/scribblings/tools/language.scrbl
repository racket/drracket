@index{drracket:language:simple-settings}
This mixin uses a struct definition for its settings:
@racketblock[
(define-struct drracket:language:simple-settings
  (case-sensitive  (code:comment @#,t{boolean?})
   printing-style  (code:comment @#,t{(symbols 'constructor 'quasiquote 'write 'print)})

                   (code:comment @#,t{         'test-coverage)})

The settings in this structure reflect the settings show in the language
configuration dialog for languages constructed with this mixin.  The
first controls the input for the language.  The rest specify printing
controls for the language.  The style @racket['print] is the default
style, as normally used in the Racket REPL.  The sharing field
determines if cycles and sharing in values are displayed when the value
is rendered.  The insert newlines field determines if values in the repl
are formatted with @racket[write] style-line printouts, or with
@racket[pretty-print] multi-line printouts.

@defmethod[(config-panel)

  This method is called after the language is initialized, but no
  program has yet been run. It is called from the user's eventspace's
  main thread.

  See also @method[drracket:rep:text% initialize-console].

  Calling this method should not escape.  DrRacket calls this method in
  a @racket[parameterize] where the @racket[error-escape-handler] is set
  to an escaping continuation that continues initializing the
  interactions window.  Thus, raising an exception will report the error
  in the user's interactions window as if this were a bug in the user's
  program.  Escaping in any other way, however, can cause DrRacket to
  fail to start up.

  Also, IO system will deadlock if the @racket[first-opened] method does
  IO on the user's IO ports, so the calling context of
  @racket[first-opened] sets the @racket[current-output-port] and
  @racket[current-error-port] to ports that just collect all of the IO
  that happened and then replay it later in the initialization of the
  user's program.

  Contrary to the method contract spec, DrRacket will also invoke this
  method if it has zero arguments, passing nothing; the zero argument
  version is for backwards compatibility and is not recommended.

           (-> (or/c sexp/c syntax? eof-object?))]{
  @racket[front-end/complete-program] method reads and parses a program
  in the language. The @racket[port] argument contains all of the data
  to be read (until eof) and the name of the @racket[port] (obtained via
  @racket[object-name]) is a value representing the source of the
  program (typically an editor, but may also be a string naming a file
  or some other value).  The @racket[settings] argument is the current
  settings for the language.

  The @racket[front-end/complete-program] method is expected to return a
  thunk that is called repeatedly to get all of the expressions in the
  program. When all expressions have been read, the thunk is expected to
  return @racket[eof].

  This method is only called for programs in the definitions
  window. Notably, it is not called for programs that are
  @racket[load]ed or @racket[eval]ed.  See @racket[current-load] and
  @racket[current-eval] for those.

  This method is expected to raise an appropriate exception if the
  program is malformed, eg an @racket[exn:syntax] or @racket[exn:read].

  This is called on the user's thread, as is the thunk it returns.

  Implementations of this method should not return fully expanded
  expressions, since there are two forms of expansion, using either
  @racket[expand] or @racket[expand-top-level-with-compile-time-evals]
  and the use of the expanded code dictates which applies.

  front-end/complete-program] is first called to get a thunk that reads
  from the program.  That thunk is called some number of times,

@defmethod[(get-language-position)

  This method returns a list of strings that is used to organize this

  category or subcategory of the language and the last entry in the list
  is the name of the language itself.  In the language dialog, each
  element in the list except for the last will be a nested turn down
  triangle on the left of the dialog.  The final entry will be the name
  that the user can choose to select this language. Names that are the
  same will be combined into the same turndown entry.

  For example, if one language's position is:
  @racketblock[
    (list "General Category" "Specific Category" "My Language")
  ]
  and another's is:
  @racketblock[
    (list "General Category" "Specific Category" "My Other Language")

  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-metadata-lines].
  The string is prefixed to the buffer before the file is saved by
  DrRacket, and removed from the buffer after it is opened in DrRacket.

  The string is expect to be a prefix to the file that sets up a reader
  for files in this language, using @tt{#reader}.

  The @racket[modname] argument's printed form is the same as the file's
  name, but without the path, and without an extension. The
  @racket[settings] argument is the current language's settings value.

  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-metadata-lines], and

@defmethod[(get-metadata-lines)
           number]{
  This method is only called when
  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-reader-module] returns an
  sexp.

  The result of the method is a count of the number of lines in the
  strings that @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-metadata]
  returns. The @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-metadata]
  function does not necessarily return the same string each time it is
  called (see @method[drracket:language:language<%> metadata->settings])
  but it is expected to always return a string with a fixed number of
  lines, as indicated by the result of this method.

@defmethod[(get-reader-module)
           (or/c sexp-representing-a-require-spec false/c)]{
  The result of this method is used when saving or loading files.

  If the result is a sexp, saved files get a prefix inserted at the
  beginning (the prefix is determined by calling
  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-metadata]).  When the file
  is then loaded, DrRacket recognizes this prefix and sets the language
  back to match the saved file.

  See also @method[drracket:language:language<%> metadata->settings],
  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-metadata-lines], and
  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-metadata].

  The style delta that this method returns is used in the language
  dialog and the DrRacket REPL when the language's name is printed.

  When it is @racket[#f], no styling is used.

  If the result is a list, each element is expected to be a list of
  three items, a style-delta, and two numbers. The style delta will be
  applied to the corresponding portion of the name.

@defmethod[(extra-repl-information [settings settings] [port output-port?]) void?]{
  This method is called on the DrRacket eventspace main thread to insert
  extra information into the REPL to reflect the state of the program.

  It is used, for example, to print out the ``Teachpack'' lines in the
  HtDP languages.

           settings]{
  This method is only called when
  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-reader-module] returns an
  sexp.

  When a file is opened in DrRacket, if this language's
  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-reader-module] returns an
  sexp, the prefix of the file (the first N lines, where N is the number
  returned by @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-metadata-lines])
  is scanned for @racket["#reader"] followed by the result of
  @method[drracket:language:language<%> get-reader-module].  If that
  pattern is found, the language is set to this language.  Also, the
  entire prefix is passed, as a string, to this method which returns a
  @racket[settings] value, used as the settings for this language.

@defmethod[(on-execute [settings settings]
                       [run-on-user-thread ((-> any) -> any)])
           any]{
  The @racket[on-execute] method is called on DrRacket's eventspace's
  main thread before any evaluation happens when the Run button is
  clicked. It is also called when a new DrRacket tab (or window) is
  created to initialize the empty interactions window.

  Use this method to initialize Racket's
  @secref[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl") "parameters"]
  for the user.  When this function is called, the user's thread has
  already been created, as has its custodian.  These parameters have
  been changed from the defaults in Racket:
  @itemize[
  @item{@racket[current-custodian] is set to a new custodian.}
  @item{@racket[current-namespace] has been set to a newly created empty
    namespace.  This namespace has the following modules copied (with
    @racket[namespace-attach-module]) from DrRacket's original
    namespace:
    @itemize[
    @item{@racket['mzscheme]}
    @item{@racket['mred]}
    ]}
  @item{@racket[read-curly-brace-as-paren] is @racket[#t],}
  @item{@racket[read-square-bracket-as-paren] is @racket[#t],}
  @item{The @racket[port-write-handler] and @racket[port-display-handler]

    @racket[pretty-display] instead of @racket[write] and
    @racket[display].  When @racket[pretty-print] and
    @racket[pretty-display] are called by these parameters, the
    @racket[pretty-print-columns] parameter is set to
    @racket['infinity], so the output looks just like @racket[write] and
    @racket[display].  This is done so that special scheme values can be
    displayed as snips.}
  @item{The @racket[current-print-covert-hook] is to a procedure so that
    @racket[snip%]s are just returned directly to be inserted into the
    interactions @racket[text%] object.}
  @item{The output and input ports are set to point to the interactions
    window with these parameters: @racket[current-input-port],
    @racket[current-output-port], and @racket[current-error-port].}
  @item{The @racket[event-dispatch-handler] is set so that DrRacket can
    perform some initial setup and close down around the user's code.}
  @item{The @racket[current-directory] and
    @racket[current-load-relative-directory] are set to the directory
    where the definitions file is saved, or if it isn't saved, to the
    initial directory where DrRacket started up.}
  @item{The snip-class-list, returned by @racket[get-the-snip-class-list]

    eventspace's snip-class-list.}
  @item{The @racket[error-print-source-location] parameter is set to
    @racket[#f] and the @racket[error-display-handler] is set to a
    handler that creates an error message from the exception record,
    with font and color information and inserts that error message into
    the definitions window.}
  ]

  The @racket[run-on-user-thread] arguments accepts thunks and runs them
  on the user's eventspace's main thread.  The output ports are not yet
  functioning, so print outs should be directed to the original DrRacket
  output port, if necessary.

  This thunk is wrapped in a @racket[with-handlers] that catches all
  exceptions matching @racket[exn:fail?] and then prints out the
  exception message to the original output port of the DrRacket process.
