;; Test suite for the coverage annotations in the teaching languages.
;; Each test case specifies a teaching language (via a regexp), a string
;; to put in the definitions window and a list of strings that correspond to
;; maximal uncovered regions from the original program. Running this file
;; will fire up a drracket, put the program in the definitions, run the 
;; program, ensure that the output is only whitespace and numbers, and then 
;; make sure the coverage is as expected.

;; NB: the results of executing each of these tests (ie the stuff that shows up in the 
;; interactions window when you run the program) should be whitespace and numbers only
;; (well, plus the prompt)
