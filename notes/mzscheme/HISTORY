Version 102, ??, 2000
Switched to configure-based makefiles (autoconf)

 now a Scheme_Object*

Version 100, August 9, 1999
 + indicates a change since 100alpha4
 * indicates a change since 100alpha3
Changed class syntax, splitting public clause use into:
 public : defines ivars not in superclass
 override : defines ivars already in superclass
Changed empty superclass from the empty list to object%;
 every class initialization must call super-init
Added ivar-in-interface?
+ Added class-initialization-arity
* Added class->interface
* Added object-interface
+ Removed object-class
+ Removed ivar-in-class?; replace (ivar-in-class? x c)
 with (ivar-in-interface? (class->interface x c))
Changed interface: raises an exception if a superinterface
 declares a variable that is also declared in the interface
 expression
Removed letrec*; letrec has the same semantics
* Fixed scope of function name in a named let
Internal definitions are allowed only at the beginning of lambda,
 case-lambda, let, let-values, let*, let*-values,
 letrec, letrec-values, fluid-let, let-macro, let-id-macro,
 let-expansion-time, parameterize, and with-handlers
begin expressions are flattened in an internal-definition context
(begin) allowed in a top-level, unit, or internal-definition
 context
Removed invoke-open-unit; see the new invoke.ss library, which
 includes define-values/invoke-unit
Self-import is now allowed for unit linking
Removed constant-name and constant-name-all-globals
Removed secure-primitive-exception-types
Removed readable type symbols (e.g., #<procedure>)
Removed semaphore-callback (MrEd now has queue-callback)
Removed parameterizations (but not parameters!)
parameterize sets parameter values in parallel (like let)
 instead of in series (like let*)
* Changed the initialization of the exception handler in a new
 thread to use the value of the initial-exception-handler
 parameter
Fixed unfairness in threads (perpetually creating threads
 would starve certain threads, particularly the main thread)
Unreachable thread blocked on an unreachable semaphore is
 garbage-collectable
Added current-memory-use
Fixed weak hash table bug (could drop keys too soon)
Added optional peek-proc argument to make-input-port
Changed TCP writes to block when the underlying implementation
 blocks, and removed tcp-port-send-waiting?
Asynchronous breaks are now disabled during dynamic-wind
 pre and post thunks
Removed user-break-poll-handler; spawn a thread that sleeps and
 calls break-thread, instead
Removed dynamic-enable-break (no long needed since dynamic-wind
 post thunks can't be broken), but moved it to MzLib's thread.ss
Removed execption-break-enabled (now always disabled)
Added call-in-nested-thread
Removed thread-weight
Renamed the call-with-escaping-continution procedure to
 call-with-escape-continution (call/ec is unchanged)
Finished with-continuation-mark and current-continuation-marks
 and documented them; the errortrace poor man's debugger relies
 on continuation marks; see plt/collects/errortrace/doc.txt
Removed debug-info-handler and replaced the debug-info field
 with a continuation-marks field
Added raise-mismatch-error
MacOS: getenv and putenv work within MzScheme; if a file named
 "Environment" resides in MzScheme's folder, it provides the
 initial environment; see the documentation for details
MacOS: fixed TCP problems
Fixed read-write invariance for inexact (floating-point) numbers
Changed handling of inexact can complex numbers towards compliance
 with Brad Lucier's proposal:
  (* 0 x) = 0 for all x
  (log 1) = 0, etc.
  -0.0 and 0.0 are properly distinguished; (- 0.0) = -0.0, and
   (/ (expt 2 400) -inf.0) = -0.0; (eqv? 0.0 -0.0) = #f even
   though (= 0.0 -0.0) = #t
  Complex numbers can have an inexact real/imaginary part with
   an exact zero imaginary/real part; thus, 4.0 is different
   from 4.0+0.0i, and 0+4.0i is different from 0.0+4.0i; note
   that (sqrt -4.0) is 0+2.0i
  Complex numbers can have a +nan.0 real/imaginary part with
   an imaginary/real part that is not +nan.0
All zero-length vectors are eq
Vectors are written (but not displayed) using the Chez-style
 #n(...) shorthand by default; added print-vector-length
 parameter
* The value of a built-in procedure is eq across namespaces
Replaced require-library-use-compiled with use-compiled-file-kinds
Changed interface for wills: no current executor, register-will
 -> will-register, will-executor-try -> will-try-execute, added
 will-execute
MzLib cleanup:
 Removed `@' suffix for embedded units in mzlib:core@ and mzlib@
 Removed all c.ss libraries, plus constan[t].ss
 Removed catch-errors and let-enumerate from macro.ss
 Removed make-class and make-class* from compat.ss
 Removed zsin, zcos, ztan, zasin, zacos, zatan, zlog, zexp,
  and zsqrt from zmath.ss (MzScheme's built-ins do complex)
 Moved from functio.ss to thread.ss: dynamic-disable-break,
  make-single-threader
 Removed from functio.ss: dynamic-wind/protect-break
 Added to thread.ss: dynamic-enable-break
 Moved MzLib's compat.ss out of the core
 Removes all but the first two arguments to pretty-print (the
  rest have parameters, which are more convenient anyway)
 Changed require to reference-file in refer.ss
file.ss library: added make-directory*
pretty-print: default display string handler is now the default
 port display handler instead of the display procedure
Ported to BeOS
Ported to OSKit
Ported to LinuxThreads, sortof; semaphore-waiting threads cannot
 be broken or killed
Inside MzScheme: new built-in type: scheme_complex_izi_type
Inside MzScheme: changed scheme_eval_string to raise an exception
 if the expression returns multiple values, and added
 scheme_eval_string_multi

Version 53, July 25, 1998
Changed file-modify-seconds to file-or-directory-modify-seconds
Changed rename-file to rename-file-or-directory
Changed file procedures to return void on success and raise
 and exception on failure: delete-file, rename-file-or-directory,
 file-size, copy-file, make-directory, delete-directory
Changed the procedures file-or-directory-modify-seconds and 
 file-or-directory-permissions to raise an exception if the
 file/directory does not exist
Changed current-drive to raise exn:misc:unsupported on platforms
 other than Windows
Added find-system-path
Fixed expand-defmacro for initialization argument expressions
 in a class*/names form
Fixed call/ec bug related to dynamic-wind (see !!! in 
 tests/basic.ss)
Fixed dynamic-wind bug: multiple levels of pre-thunks for a
 jump into a continuation were evaluated in reverse order
Fixed atan: second argument is allowed to be an exact non-integer
Fixed equal?: comparisons on equivalent vectors or structs
 with cycles no longer crash (until MzScheme runs out of memory)
Added make-temporary-file to MzLib's file.ss
Changed random and random-seed to use a parameter-specified
 random number generator; the generator is initially
 seeded with a number based on (current-milliseconds)
Removed the obsolete MzLib trigger library
Added with-continuation-mark and current-continuation-marks,
 but these have not yet been documented because their
 semanticses are not yet finalized

Version 52, May 25, 1998
R5RS non-compliance reduced to macros
Added scheme-report-environment, null-environment, and
 interaction-environment
Changed reference-library, etc. to require-library
 and changed require-library, etc. to require-library/proc
Changed uq-ivar and uq-make-gerenric to ivar/proc and 
 make-generic/proc
current-directory is now a parameter
Added simplify-path
Changed execute and execute* to exit via the exit handler
Top-level definitions are no longer allowed in the branches 
 of an if expression; consider replacing an expression like
 (if ... (define x ...)) with 
 (if ... (global-defined-value 'x ...))
expand-defmacro now signals the same set of syntax errors
 as compile and eval
local-expand-defmacro no longer expands define expressions
 in a non-top-level context; to implement a macro that
 detects define forms, use local-expand-body-expression
Fixed bug in (let/ec a (let/ec b (let/cc k ...))); calling
 b then k then a would fail, jumping to b instead of a
Fixed read-eval-print loop when jumping to the continuation
 of a previous eval and raising an exception there before
 the evaluation finishes
regexp-replace and regexp-replace*: \$ ("\\$" in Scheme)
 is now replaced by the empty string; this allows forms
 like "\\0\\$3", which inserts the 1st submatch and "3"
Fixed a potential bug with continuations (although I never
 saw it happen); they need to be marked by the GC with
 interior pointer marking
Changed read-line to break lines only on #\newline by default;
 new optional argument roughly parameterizes over the 
 line-breaking character(s)
Add read-string and read-string! for reading a block
 of characters from a port
Changed MzLib's read-string and read-string-all to
 read-from-string and read-from-string-all
Changed MzLib's with-semaphore to return the value returned
 by the thunk.
Added the command-line macro to MzLib's cmdline.ss
Linux and FreeBSD: turned on support for using more
 than 256 file descriptors
Inside MzScheme: current-directory, now a parameter, no
 longer sets the current directory as managed by the OS
Inside MzScheme: scheme_split_pathname changed
Inside MzScheme: scheme_setcwd and scheme_getcwd renamed to
 scheme_os_setcwd and scheme_os_getcwd; these set and get the
 OS-managed cwd, but they have no effect on the current 
 directory seen by Scheme code

Version 51, March 25, 1998
Changed load/use-compiled: searches for .zo files in
 a "compiled/" subdirectory, and searches for .so/.dll
 files in (build-path "compiled" (system-library-subpath))
Changed load and current-load/default-load-handler: `load'
 now sets the current-load-relative-directory, so a load
 handler does not need to set this parameter
Added current-load-extension (load-extension handler)
Unix: fixed file-or-directory-permissions for group-based 
 permissions when the group is not the current group (but
 still includes the user)
Windows: fixed directory-exists? et al. for UNC paths
Added local-expand-body-expression
Removed input-port-post-semaphore; this procedure can be
 implemented using thread, peek-char, and semaphore-post
Fixed thread: thunk can return any number of values
Fixed custodian-shutdown-all: if it has to shutdown the
 current thread, it does so immediately instead of
 waiting for the next thread context switch
Fixed will executors: will can return multiple values
Added link-exists?
Added copy-file
Added path-list-string->path-list
Added collection-path
The delete-file and rename-file functions now reliably work
 on links rather than the destination of the link (now fixed
 for MacOS and documented this way)
Fixed rename-file: works for directories too, but the
 destination file/directory cannot exist already.
Added a new mode flag for open-output-file et al.:
 'truncate/replace tries 'truncate then 'replace
Changed initial setting of current-library-collection-paths
Unit definitions and embedded definitions are not allowed
 to shadow syntax or macro names; this restriction resolves
 all potential ambiguity resulting from shadowing syntax
Changed display for symbols containg special characters:
 the special characters are not escaped (or bar-quoted)
Changed write to use the value of (read-accept-bar-quote)
 for printing symbols containing special charaters; if
 bar qute reading is off, it is turned off for printing, too
Fixed unit/sig: correctly handles syntax where defintions in 
 the unit shadow syntactic forms
Fixed round of exact rational n/d in the case when (odd? d)
 and (= (remainder n d) (quotient d 2))
Extended exp, sin, cos, tan, log, asin, acons, atan to
 complex numbers; changed sqrt to choose the root with a
 positive real part
Removed rectangular <, >, <=, >= for complex numbers
Changed storage of loaded-library table from built into the
 `require-library' procedure to built into the current
 namespace
Added require-relative-library
Fixed error messages for +, -, etc. to show all arguments
Fixed format, fprintf, and printf: "~~" allowed at the end
 of the format string
Fixed with-handlers: predicate procedures are evaluated
 with the same exception handler as a handler procedure
Added send-event, currently only supported for MacOS
Changed MzLib's pconver.ss libraries; the print-convert-hook@
 unit was removed (along with the pchookr.ss library) and
 replaced with parameters defined in pconverr.ss for similar
 (more powerful) hooks.
Fixed interfaces for compiled-file (.zo) loading across
 MzScheme startups
Fixed bug in ports returned by make-pipe that caused
 spurious eofs
Unused interned symbols are now garbage-collected
Added support for single-precision floating points (turned
 off in default compilation)
Changed read-eval-print-loop, removing its cooperation with
 the default error escape handler; instead, it installs its
 own error escape handler
Improved the support for dynamic extensions that gives an 
 error if an extension is already loaded, or calls a
 reloading function provided by the extension (scheme_reload)
Unix images: removed constraint against using stdio before
 dumps, but images are disabled by default. Also added
 read-image-from-file procedure
MzLib functio.ss: added remv*, remq*, remove*, filter,
 assf, memf, empty, and empty?
MzLib file.ss: added remove-directory/files
MzLib constan.ss: added constant-signature-content macro
MzLib pconver.ss: added whole/fractional-exact-numbers and
 empty-list-name
MzLib pretty.ss: added pretty-print-show-inexactness
MzLib compile.ss: changed the set of compilation flags
Removed begin-expansion-time
Moved begin-elaboration-time from MzLib into MzScheme
Added MzLib library traceld.ss
MacOS: MzScheme always prompts for extra arguments, even if
  a file is dragged onto the application or a launcher program
  starts it
MacOS: Fixed problems with inexact arithmetic: inexact->exact
  for certain negative numbers and miscellaenous inf.0 and
  nan.0 problems
Windows: CYGWIN32 gcc compiler now supported
Inside MzScheme: scheme_setjmp and scheme_longjmp now
 work on values of type mz_jmp_buf instead of jmp_buf
Inside MzScheme: scheme_apply_multi and scheme_apply were
 reversed! (The _ forms where ok.)
Upgraded to gc 4.13alpha1

Version 50, August 26, 1997
Added compile-time inferrence of names for closures, classes,
  and units to improve error messages

  radix argument
Bug fixed in call/cc related to dynamic-wind (see !!! in 
  tests/basic.ss)
Fixed weak hash table's accumulation of hashing buckets
Added 'empty flag for make-namespace
Added two-argument form for global-defined-value

  multiple superclasses
uq-ivar always takes two arguments; class is not a legal argument
uq-make-generic accepts a class or an interface
Object system exceptions changed
Added custodian system
Embedded define conventions changed: "regular" defines are only
  allowed in begin expressions and the branches of an if;
  embedded defines can appear in a begin0 expression, but not
  in the first position; defines must all appear at the beginning
  of the block
Contents of a begin expression as an immediate unit or unit/sig 
  expression are promoted to immediate expressions
case supports only R4RS syntax; a single non-list "datum" is
  no longer allowed

 handler while loading a file) and load-relative (uses the
 parameter for loading a relative filename)
unit/sig's include form is like load-relative instead of load/cd
require-library uses load or load/use-compiled instead of load/cd
Windows: expand-path does not put a drive on a driveless path
  anymore; use path->complete-path instead
compile-file moved out of MzScheme into MzLib "compile.ss"; now 
  takes a single flag list argument instead of two final Booleans
current-base-parameterization parameter replaced with 
  parameterization-branch-handler parameter
Parameterizations support sharing (in addition to defaulting);
  see docs for make-parameterization-with-sharing
Added print, port print handlers, and a global port print handler
Changed the default print handler to use print instead of write
Fixed bug in ports returned by make-pipe
Fixed bug in dynamic-wind; continuation jumps into the pre-thunk
  had a non-intuitive semantics; the correct semantics is now 
  implemented and documented (also for jumps with the post-thunk)
Changed time-apply to always return a list as its first return
  value; time form can return multiple values for its expressions
format, fprintf, and printf are case-insensitive for ~ directives;
  added ~v, ~e, ~<whitespace>
Added semaphore-wait/enable-break
Added thread-running? and thread-wait
Fixed bug in threads and timed sleeping
Fixed bug in breaking a blocked thread
Fixed bug in continuations returning multiple values through a
  dynamic-wind (multiple return values could be corrupted)

Fixed Windows system* and read from console stdin and process*
  ports: MzScheme threads no longer blocked; ctl-c breaking works
  in stand-alone console MzScheme
process and process* now return a list of 5 values (instead of 4)
map, for-each, andmap, and ormap raise exn:application:map-arity
 when the procedure's arity does not match the number of supplied
 lists; note that (map (lambda () 10) null) now signals an error
list-ref and list-tail accept arbitrarily large indices
Type for indices changed: must be an exact integer (matches R4RS better)
  affects make-vector, vector-ref, vector-set!, make-string, string-ref, 
  string-set!, substring, and struct-ref
make-namespace's '[no-]set!-undefined and '[no-]auto-else flags
  removed; replaced with two new parameters: 
  compile-allow-set!-undefined and compile-allow-cond-fallthrough
Fixed in units: (define x y) (define y 0) x => #<undefined> instead of 
  #<void>
exn:struct's super-type field renamed struct-type for consistency
exn:i/o:filesystem:filename split into exn:i/o:filesystem:path
  and exn:i/o:filesystem:file; username exception moved under path
Unix: system no longer blocks other MzScheme threads
Unix: processes created by process and process* are not zombies forever, 
  anymore. (The SIGCHLD signal is handled appropriately.)
MacOS: dynamic extension suopport via CFM (PPC only in the distributed
  applications from PLT)
Windows: removed attempted fix for thread-blocking problem 
  when reading stdin from console
Fixed auto-flush of stdout for read of stdin

 library bugs:
   Linux: strtod("0e...", ...) quits looking after "0"
   SunOS/Solaris: strtod(".3e2666666666") returned 0.0
   HP/UX: strtod(".3e2666666666") fails
Windows: fixed thread-blocking problem for reading stdin from console
Insize MzScheme: when working with "fd_set" values, use
  MZ_FD_ZERO, MZ_FD_SET, MZ_FD_CLR, MZ_FD_ISSET; use 
  scheme_get_fdset() to get the second or third fd_set in an array;
  routines for thread-blocking are now documented in "Inside MzScheme"

 (still flushed by read and read-line)
Added port-display-handler and port-write-handler

Added complete-path? and current-drive (for Windows)
Fixed (begin (values ...) ...) and (begin0 (values ...) ...)
Fixed comparisons between inexact and exact when the
