MzScheme (pronounced "Ms. Scheme") is an implementation of R4RS Scheme
extended with an object system and time-preempted threads.  It uses
libscheme 0.5's interface for embedding and/or extending the core
interpreter with other C/C++ programs. MzScheme's virtual machine,
implemented in C, is easily ported to any platform with 32-bit or
64-bit addresses. MzScheme is used in MrEd, an engine for portable GUI
applications.

Please see the file LICENSE for license information.

Documentation and up-to-date information about MzScheme are at
 http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/mzscheme/

If you are compiling MzScheme, see the INSTALL file for compilation
instructions. 

If you have a compiled MzScheme, then the `mzlib' directory should be
in a `collects' directory that is in the same directory as the
`mzscheme' executable. If you use the PLT directory configuration,
then `plt/.bin/PLATFORM/' (where PLATFORM is a tag indicating your
platform, as returned by `plt/bin/archsys') should contain the binary
and `plt/collects' should contain `mzlib'.

See SCRIPTS for information about writing MzScheme scripts for Unix
platforms.
