This is the MzScheme source code distribution. Please see the file
plt/LICENSE for license information.

Compiled binaries, documentation, and up-to-date information about
MzScheme are at:
 http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/mzscheme/

MzScheme should compile (via `mzmake') and execute without
modification on most platforms. You may have to adjust some flags in
the Makefile and "sconfig.h".  Special per-platform instructions are
below, followed by some general notes on compilation and changing
MzScheme. (Please read the general notes if you plan on changing
MzScheme or the default compilation flags.)

 Compiling for Unix (or Cygwin or BeOS)
========================================================================

Compile
-------

Run the `mzmake' script to compile the `mzscheme' executable for the
following platforms:

  Alpha OSF1
  BeOS
  DEC Ultrix
  HP/UX
  i386 FreeBSD
  i386 Linux
  i386 Solaris [see note below]
  i386 Win32 with Cygwin [beta 20]
  PPC Linux
  RS6000 AIX
  SGI IRIX
  Sparc Solaris [see note below]
  Sparc SunOS4    

[Solaris Note: To ensure that dynamic extensions work right, make sure
 your compiler uses the native Solaris `ld' rather than GNU's `ld'.]

[Solaris 2.7 Note: gcc 2.8.1 does not work correctly under Solaris
 2.7, producing a MzScheme binary that crashes. Thanks to Stever Hall
 for figuring this out in a long--and presumably torturous--process.
 Compiling under Solaris 2.6 or compiling without -O under Solaris 2.7
 apparently solves the problem.]

To compile the `mzscheme' executable for other Unix platforms:

  1) Edit the Makefile if necessary. Common changes include the C
     compiler name, compiler flags, the ranlib processor (if your
     machine does not have `ranlib', set RANLIB to ':'), and
     libraries. If Boehm's conservative garbage collector is not
     supported for the platform, use SenoraGC by setting GCDIR to
     'sgc' and including '-DUSE_SENORA_GC' in OPTIONS.

  2) Edit "sconfig.h" to set platform-specific flags if necessary.

  3) Execute `make bin' (or just `make').

  [Cygwin note: either use `mzmake', or run `make cygwin-dll-setup'
   and `make starter' before `make bin'.]

Install
-------

After compiling MzScheme, `[mz]make install' copies the binary and
libraries into their normal places in the plt tree relative to the
source directory. (For example, mzscheme is copied to to
../../.bin/<platform-id>/mzscheme for unix, ../../mzscheme.exe for
Cygwin.)

Unix and BeOS: After running `[mz]make install', run ./install in the
plt directory (two directories up from here). Afterwards,
plt/bin/setup-plt and plt/bin/mzc work. If you move the plt tree,
re-run plt/install.

Cygwin: Create the other executables (besides mred.exe
and mzscheme.exe) by running
   mzscheme.exe -mvqL- setup.ss compiler
in the plt directory (two directories up from here). The above makes
the .zo files, too, but add -n to the end of the command to skip the
.zo-compiling step. Afterwards, `plt/Setup PLT.exe' and `plt/mzc.exe'
work.

Compiling Parts
---------------

To compile parts of MzScheme for embedding or extending:

  * `[mz]make mzschemelib' (or `mzmake mzschemelib') compiles 
     libmzscheme.a and libgc.a and puts them in lib/sys

  * `[mz]make libguile' creates lib/sys/libguile.a; this is
     libmzscheme.a + libgc.a + compatibility routines to support
     GNU's emerging GUILE high-level interface specification
     (still experimental, and with an unpromising future)

  * `[mz]make dynlib' compiles mzdyn.o (for linking
     dynamically-loaded extensions to MzScheme) and puts
     it in lib/sys

  * `[mz]make g-c' compiles /lib/sys/libgc.a only

See also plt/collects/mzscheme/examples/ for some example extensions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling for Multiple Unix Platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MzScheme's Unix makefiles are set up to support compilation for
multiple platforms in the same filesystem. To differentiate platforms
for the makefiles, set the MZPLTFORMSUFFIX environment
variable. Object files (.o files) are placed in the subdirectory
  objects/sys${MZPLTFORMSUFFIX} 
and library files (.a files) are placed in the subdirectory 
  objects/lib${MZPLTFORMSUFFIX}

MZPLTFORMSUFFIX does not need to be defined if you are only compiling
for a single platform. In this case, object files are put in
  objects/sys
and library files are put in
  lib/sys

The destination for the `mzscheme' binary does not use the
MZPLTFORMSUFFIX environment variable. (That would be too easy.)
Instead, the MZBUILDDIR environment variable designates a destination
directory for the binary. If MZBUILDDIR is not defined, the binary is
placed in the same directory as the main "Makefile".

========================================================================
 Compiling for Windows
========================================================================

To compile with MSVC, read the instructions in "plt\src\worksp\README".

To compile with Cygwin's gcc, follow the Unix instructions above.

========================================================================
 Compiling for MacOS
========================================================================

Unpack the Compactor archive plt:src:cw.cpt to plt:src:cw and then
see `ABOUT MZSCHEME' in that folder.

========================================================================
 Compiling the OSKit-based kernel
========================================================================

Run `./oskmake' to build the OSKit-based MzScheme kernel. See `oskmake'
for information about build options.

For simplicity, the MzScheme kernel uses SGC rather than Boehm's
conservative garbage collector. The `oskmake' script sets the
necessary compilation flags.

========================================================================
 General Compilation Notes
========================================================================

By default, MzScheme is compiled:

 * without image dumps (since the application will probably be linked
   dynamically);

 * without using any OS-specific threads; and

 * without support for simple-precision floating point numbers.

These options can be changed by modifying sconfig.h or specifying -D
compiler flags for the macros described in sconfig.h. (In the latter
case, you may find it convenient to edit `mzmake'.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you modify MzScheme and change any primitive syntax or the
collection of built-in identifers, be sure to turn off
USE_COMPILED_MACROS in schminc.h. Otherwise, MzScheme won't start.
See schminc.h for details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The conservative garbage collector distributed with MzScheme has been
modified slightly from Boehm's standard distribution.
