MzScheme should compile and execute with little or no modification if
you have an ANSI C compiler on any platform supported by the
conservative garbage collector. Some flags may need adjustment in the
Makefile and "sconfig.h".  Special per-platform instructions are
below, followed by some general notes on compilation.

========================================================================
 Unix
========================================================================

To compile the `mzscheme' executable for these platforms:
  Alpha OSF1
  DEC Ultrix
  HP/UX
  i386 FreeBSD
  i386 Linux
  RS6000 AIX
  SGI IRIX
  Sparc Solaris [see note below]
  Sparc SunOS4    
run the `mzmake' script.

[Solaris Note: To ensure that dynamic extensions work right, use the
 native Solaris `ld' rather than GNU's `ld'.]

Or, to compile the `mzscheme' executable for other Unix platforms:

        1) Edit the Makefile if necessary. Common changes include the 
           C compiler, compiler flags, ranlib processor (if your
           machine does not have `ranlib', set RANLIB to ':'), and
           libraries

        2) Edit "sconfig.h" to set platform-specific flags if necessary

        3) Execute `make bin' (or just `make')

To compile parts of MzScheme for embedding or extending:

        * `[mz]make mzschemelib' (or `mzmake mzschemelib') compiles 
           libmzscheme.a and libgc.a and puts them in lib/sys

        * `[mz]make mzschemelib++' is like `make lib', but the GC C++
           tools are included in libgc.a

        * `[mz]make libguile' creates lib/sys/libguile.a; this is
           libmzscheme.a + libgc.a + compatibility routines to support
           GNU's emerging GUILE high-level interface specification
           (still experimental)

        * `[mz]make dynlib' compiles mzdyn.o (for writing
           dynamically-loaded extensions to MzScheme) and puts
           it in lib/sys

        * `[mz]make g-c' just compiles /lib/sys/libgc.a

        * `[mz]make dynexample' compiles the example dynamic
           extension objects/sys/dynexmpl.so; when this is loaded into
           MzScheme, (by using load-extension), it defines a "date" 
           procedure

        * `[mz]make oe' compiles a larger example dynamic
           extension objects/sys/oe.so; when this is loaded into
           MzScheme, (by using load-extension), it defines "odd",
           "even", "fib", and "fib2" procedures, and returns
           two values (#t and #f) when loaded

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling for Multiple Unix Platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MzScheme's Unix makefiles are set up to support compilation for
multiple platforms in the same filesystem. To differentiate platforms
for the makefiles, set the MZPLTFORMSUFFIX environment
variable. Object files (.o files) are placed in the subdirectory
  objects/sys${MZPLTFORMSUFFIX} 
and library files (.a files) are placed in the subdirectory 
  objects/lib${MZPLTFORMSUFFIX}

MZPLTFORMSUFFIX does not need to be defined if you are only compiling
for a single platform. In this case, object files are put in
  objects/sys
and library files are put in
  lib/sys

The destination for the `mzscheme' binary does not use the
MZPLTFORMSUFFIX enrionment variable. (That would be too easy.)
Instead, the MZBUILDDIR envionrment variable designates a destination
directory for the binary. If MZBUILDDIR is not defined, the binary is
placed in the same directory as the main "Makefile".

========================================================================
 Windows
========================================================================

The `windows' directory contains additional files and information for
Windows users.

========================================================================
 MacOS
========================================================================

The file `mac.sit.hqx' contains additional files and information for
MacOS users.

========================================================================
 General Compilation Notes
========================================================================

By default, MzScheme is compiled:

 * without image dumps (since the application will probably be linked
   dynamically);

 * without using any OS-specific threads; and

 * without support for simple-precision floating point numbers.

This can be changed by modifying sconfig.h or specifying -D compiler
flags for the macros described in sconfig.h. (In the latter case, you
may find it conveneient to edit `mzmake'.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The conservative garbage collector distributed with MzScheme has been
modified slightly from Boehm's standard distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you modify MzScheme and change any primitive syntax or the
collection of built-in identifers, be sure to turn of
USE_COMPILED_MACROS in schminc.h. Otherwise, MzScheme won't start up.
