Version 51, ??, 1997
Changed load/use-compiled: searches for .zo files in
  a "compiled/" subdirectory, and searches for .so/.dll
  files in (build-path "compiled" (system-library-subpath))
Changed load and current-load/default-load-handler: `load'
  now sets the current-load-relative-directory, so a load
  handler does not need to set this parameter
Added current-load-extension (load-extension handler)
Added read-image-from-file procedure
Unix images: removed constraint against using stdio before
 dumps
Unix: fixed file-or-directory-permissions for group-based 
 permissions when the group is not the current group (but
 still includes the user)
Windows: fixed directory-exists? et. al for UNC paths
Added local-expand-body-expression
Added link-exists?
Added copy-file
Added path-list-string->path-list
Added collection-path
Changed initial setting of current-library-collection-paths
Changed display for symbols containg special characters:
 the special characters are not escaped (or bar-quoted)
Changed write to use the value of (read-accept-bar-quote)
 for printing symbols containing special charaters; if
 bar qute reading is off, it is turned off for printing, too.
Fixed unit/sig: correctly handles syntax where defintions in 
 the unit shadow syntactic forms
Fixed round of exact rational n/d in the case when (odd? d)
 and (= (remainder n d) (quotient d 2))
Extended exp, sin, cos, tan, log, asin, acons, atan to
 complex numbers; changed sqrt to choose the root with a
 positive real part
Removed rectangular <, >, <=, >= for complex numbers
Changed storage of loaded-library table from built into the
 `require-library' procedure to built into the current
 namespace
Added require-relative-library
Fixed error messages for +, -, etc. to show all arguments
Changed MzLib's pconver.ss libraries; the print-convert-hook@
 unit was removed (along with the pchookr.ss library) and
 replaced with parameters defined in pconverr.ss for similar
 (more powerful) hooks.
Fixed interfaces for compiled-file (.zo) loading across
 MzScheme startups
Unused interned symbols are now garbage-collected
Added support for single-precision floating points (turned
 off in default compilation)
Changed read-eval-print-loop, removing its cooperation with
 the default error escape handler; instead, it installs its
 own error escape handler
Improved the support for dynamic extensions that gives an 
 error if an extension is already loaded, or calls a
 reloading function provided by the extension (scheme_reload)

Version 50, August 26, 1997
Added compile-time inferrence of names for closures, classes,
  and units to improve error messages
Added inferred-name
Added file-size
Added write-image-to-file for creating heap images of a

  tests/basic.ss)
Fixed weak hash table's accumulation of hashing buckets
Added 'empty flag for make-namespace
Added two-argument form for global-defined-value

Version 49, May 31, 1997 
Multiple superclass inheritance is no longer supported
Added (Java-ish) interfaces to object system
class* syntax changed to accomodate interfaces and removed
  multiple superclasses
uq-ivar always takes two arguments; class is not a legal argument
uq-make-generic accepts a class or an interface
Object system exceptions changed
Added custodian system
Embedded define conventions changed: "regular" defines are only
  allowed in begin expressions and the branches of an if;
  embedded defines can appear in a begin0 expression, but not
  in the first position; defines must all appear at the beginning
  of the block
Contents of a begin expression as an immediate unit or unit/sig 
  expression are promoted to immediate expressions
case supports only R4RS syntax; a single non-list "datum" is
  no longer allowed
Removed catch; use let/ec instead
Removed vector-append
Removed load-with-cd (use load/cd)
Added load/use-compiled
Added current-load-directory parameter (set by the default load
 handler while loading a file) and load-relative (uses the
 parameter for loading a relative filename)
unit/sig's include form is like load-relative instead of load/cd
require-library uses load or load/use-compiled instead of load/cd
Windows: expand-path does not put a drive on a driveless path
  anymore; use path->complete-path instead
compile-file moved out of MzScheme into MzLib "compile.ss"; now 
  takes a single flag list argument instead of two final Booleans
current-base-parameterization parameter replaced with 
  parameterization-branch-handler parameter
Parameterizations support sharing (in addition to defaulting);
  see docs for make-parameterization-with-sharing
Added print, port print handlers, and a global port print handler
Changed the default print handler to use print instead of write
Fixed bug in ports returned by make-pipe
Fixed bug in dynamic-wind; continuation jumps into the pre-thunk
  had a non-intuitive semantics; the correct semantics is now 
  implemented and documented (also for jumps with the post-thunk)
Changed time-apply to always return a list as its first return
  value; time form can return multiple values for its expressions
format, fprintf, and printf are case-insensitive for ~ directives;
  added ~v, ~e, ~<whitespace>
Added semaphore-wait/enable-break
Added thread-running? and thread-wait
Fixed bug in threads and timed sleeping
Fixed bug in breaking a blocked thread
Fixed bug in continuations returning multiple values through a
  dynamic-wind (multiple return values could be corrupted)

Fixed Windows system* and read from console stdin and process*
  ports: MzScheme threads no longer blocked; ctl-c breaking works
  in stand-alone console MzScheme
process and process* now return a list of 5 values (instead of 4)
map, for-each, andmap, and ormap raise exn:application:map-arity
 when the procedure's arity does not match the number of supplied
 lists; note that (map (lambda () 10) null) now signals an error
list-ref and list-tail accept arbitrarily large indices
Type for indices changed: must be an exact integer (matches R4RS better)
  affects make-vector, vector-ref, vector-set!, make-string, string-ref, 
  string-set!, substring, and struct-ref
make-namespace's '[no-]set!-undefined and '[no-]auto-else flags
  removed; replaced with two new parameters: 
  compile-allow-set!-undefined and compile-allow-cond-fallthrough
Fixed in units: (define x y) (define y 0) x => #<undefined> instead of 
  #<void>
exn:struct's super-type field renamed struct-type for consistency
exn:i/o:filesystem:filename split into exn:i/o:filesystem:path
  and exn:i/o:filesystem:file; username exception moved under path
Unix: system no longer blocks other MzScheme threads
Unix: processes created by process and process* are not zombies forever, 
  anymore. (The SIGCHLD signal is handled appropriately.)
MacOS: dynamic extension suopport via CFM (PPC only in the distributed
  applications from PLT)
Windows: removed attempted fix for thread-blocking problem 
  when reading stdin from console
Fixed auto-flush of stdout for read of stdin

Added will executors
pretty-print-print-hook and pretty-print-size-hook now take
 three arguments: value display? port

Fixed errors reading floating-point constants due to system
 library bugs:
   Linux: strtod("0e...", ...) quits looking after "0"
   SunOS/Solaris: strtod(".3e2666666666") returned 0.0
   HP/UX: strtod(".3e2666666666") fails
Windows: fixed thread-blocking problem for reading stdin from console
Insize MzScheme: when working with "fd_set" values, use
  MZ_FD_ZERO, MZ_FD_SET, MZ_FD_CLR, MZ_FD_ISSET; use 
  scheme_get_fdset() to get the second or third fd_set in an array;
  routines for thread-blocking are now documented in "Inside MzScheme"

 (still flushed by read and read-line)
Added port-display-handler and port-write-handler
