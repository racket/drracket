This is the source code for MysterX.  Compilation requires 
Visual C++ 6.0.

	nmake clean

gets rid of existing binaries, while 

	nmake

compiles all the binaries.

In the Makefile, there are several variables to set:

  o MZC - path to the mzc compiler
  o HTMLHELP - directory for MS Help Workshop
  o SHELL32 - directory containing LIB/SHELL32.LIB
     and related header files
  o REGSVR32 - path to the REGSVR32 utility
  o NEWMSHTML - either 0 or 1, depending on
     on the version of MSHTML.H used (see below)

You may need to change these according to your local
installation before compiling.  The REGSVR32 utility
is ordinarily located in the Windows\SYSTEM directory
under Windows 95/98, and in the WINNT\System32 directory
under Windows NT/2000.

If you get errors about a missing file atlbase.h,
check the value of the environment variable INCLUDE.
The subdirectory ATL beneath the Visual C++ directory
needs to be in the list of INCLUDE directories.
For example, if Visual Studio 6 is installed at the root of
the C: drive, that directory would be

  C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\ATL

The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop must be installed to
build mysterx.dll.  The files are on the Visual Studio
CD in the directory HTMLHELP in the file HTMLHELP.EXE.  Run
that program to install the files.  Alternatively, Help 
Workshop may be downloaded from the Web, at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tools/htmlhelp/wkshp/download_main.htm

The code for mx_element_focus in htmlutil.cxx uses the
COM interface IHTMLElement2.  That interface is defined
in MSHTML.H in recent versions of the Platform SDK (more 
recent than the VC++6 release).  If you don't have such a 
Platform SDK, set the variable NEWMSHTML to 0 in Makefile
(or comment out the code in the body of that function).
