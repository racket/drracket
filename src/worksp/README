This directory contains makefiles and projects files for building
MzScheme and MrEd with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version 6. MzScheme
(but not MrEd) also compiles with Cygwin gcc (a free compiler from GNU
and Cygnus Solutions); to compile with gcc, follow the instructions in
plt\src\mzscheme\README (there is a short Windows-specific section in
that file.)

As always, submit bug reports using
  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/Bugs/
or (as a last resort) send mail to
  plt-bugs@cs.rice.edu

Building MzScheme and MrEd
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The source code for MzScheme and MrEd is split into several
projects. To make the project named `X', either open the file
plt\src\worksp\X\X.dsw with MSVC, or go into plt\src\worksp\X\ and
execute `nmake -f X.mak' (assuming the MSVC programs are in your
path).

 NOTE: The makefiles as distributed do not contain dependencies. Thus,
 if you modify a header file and recompile using `nmake', some files
 may not be recompiled as they should be. To get makefiles with
 dependencies, open the X.dsw files in MSVC and export new makefiles.

To build MzScheme, make the MzScheme project in
   plt\src\worksp\mzscheme - makes plt\mzscheme.exe

To build MrEd, make the MrEd project:
   plt\src\worksp\mred - makes plt\mred.exe

The make process for MzScheme automatically builds the following:
   gc - makes plt\src\worksp\gc\Release\gc.lib
   mzsrc - makes plt\src\worksp\mzsrc\Release\mzsrc.lib

The make process for MrEd automatically builds the following:
   gc - makes plt\src\worksp\gc\Release\gc.lib
   mzsrc - makes plt\src\worksp\mzsrc\Release\mzsrc.lib
   wxutils - makes ... you get the idea
   wxwin
   wxs

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra stuff for MzScheme and MrEd
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're building from scratch, you'll also want the starter
programs used by the launcher collection to make drscheme.exe
and mzc.exe:
   mzstart - makes plt\collects\launcher\mzstart.exe
   mrstart - makes plt\collects\launcher\mrstart.exe
You'll also want to install the libraries and object files
for creating MzScheme extensions (or using mzc):
   cd plt\src\mzscheme\dynsrc
   mkmzdyn.bat (requires cl.exe and lib.exe in your path)
Then, set up all the other executables (besides mred.exe
and mzscheme.exe) by running
   mzscheme.exe -mvqL- setup.ss compiler
(This makes the .zo files, too. To skip compiling .zos, 
add -n to the end of the above command.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Configurations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The MzScheme and MrEd projects are distributed to compile using
"Release" as the default configuration. Most of the projects support
several configurations:

  * Debug - less optimization to make debugging easier
  * Threads - use Windows threads to implement MzScheme threads
  * SGC - debugging with the SGC collector; links to SGC's
          Debug library, not its Release library
  * MT DLL - links to the standard C library as a DLL, rather than
             statically

Of course, the mzscheme Debug configuration works with the Debug
configurations of mzsrc and gc, etc.
