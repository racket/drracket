This is the MrEd source code distribution. Please see the file
plt/LICENSE for license information.

Compiled binaries, documentation, and up-to-date information about
MrEd are at
  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/mred/

MrEd should compile and execute with little or no modification if you
have GNU's make, an ANSI C/C++ compiler, and a platform supported by
Boehm's conservative garbage collector.  Special per-platform
instructions are below.

 Compiling for Unix/X
========================================================================

Compiling MrEd requires `gnumake' (or `gmake' or `make', but it must
be GNU's `make') and around 20-30 MB of disk space.

Compile MzScheme first. See plt/src/mzscheme/README.

In Make.env, change variables as necessary:

       [Note: the distributed file is configured for Linux]

   * Set the program names, such as the C compiler

   * Set OPTIONS:
        * Add -DOPERATOR_NEW_ARRAY if the C++ compiler uses separate new
          and new[] operators. For example, this flag is needed for gcc
          version 2.6.3 and later, but not for version 2.5.8.

   * Probably the XLIB and/or XINCLUDE directory lists need to be
     adjusted.

   * Perhaps some other flags should be changed for your local 
     configuration.

Once all of the setup files are ready, run `gnumake' in plt/src/mred.
(Did you get a "no targets" make error? In that case, are you using
GNU's make, which reads "GNUmakefile"?)

After MrEd is built, run `gnumake install' to install the binary into
the plt/ hierarchy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling for Multiple Unix Platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MrEd's Unix makefiles are set up to support compilation for
multiple platforms in the same filesystem. To differentiate platforms
for the makefiles, set the MZPLTFORMSUFFIX environment
variable. Object files (.o files) are placed in the subdirectory
  objects/sys${MZPLTFORMSUFFIX} 
and library files (.a files) are placed in the subdirectory 
  objects/lib${MZPLTFORMSUFFIX}
Instead of the make.env configuration file, compilation uses
  make${MZPLATFORMSUFFIX}.env

MZPLTFORMSUFFIX does not need to be defined if you are only compiling
for a single platform. In this case, object files are put in
  objects/sys
and library files are put in
  lib/sys

The destination for the `mred' binary does not use the
MZPLTFORMSUFFIX enrionment variable. (That would be too easy.)
Instead, the MRBUILDDIR environment variable designates a destination
directory for the binary. If MRBUILDDIR is not defined, the binary is
placed in the same directory as the main "Makefile".

 Compiling for Windows
========================================================================

Read the instructions in plt\src\worksp\README.

 Compiling for MacOS
========================================================================

Unpack the Compactor archive plt:src:cw.cpt to plt:src:cw and then
see `ABOUT MrEd' in that folder.
