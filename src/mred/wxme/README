This directory contains source for the wxMedia class library for
wxWindows. To compile the library libwxme.a (in UNIX), you will need
to set the environment variable WXDIR.

This code should work with wxWindows 1.62(e) and later versions.

If your platform stores the least-significant byte of an integer or
floating-point first, then add -DWXME_LSB_FIRST=1 to the flags in
`make.env'. All Intel machines need this flag, so it's done
automatically for Windows. The wxMedia classes will work fine if you
get this wrong, but files saved to disk will not be readable on other
platforms.

If you are using 1.62(e) or an earlier version, you will need to add
-DOLD_WXWINDOWS=1 to the list of compiler flags, and you will need to
edit the Makefile to add wx_gclip.o to the list of object files.

If you are using 1.63 or an earlier version, you will need to
add -DNO_GENERAL_FONTS to the list of compiler flags.

If use are using 1.66 or an earlier version (in which the method
wxDC::GetClippingRegion is not defined), you will need to add
-DNO_GET_CLIPPING_REGION to the list of compiler flags. You may
need to add -DEACH_BUFFER_OWN_OFFSCREEN to get correct drawing.

If use are using 1.66 or an earlier version (in which the method
wxDC::GetTextExtent does not use the font argument), you will need to
add -DBROKEN_GET_TEXT_EXTENT to the list of compiler flags. 

If you are using wxxt 1.64, you may have to comment out the call to
XClearArea() in wxWindow::Refresh() in wxxt/src/Windows/Window.cc.

The Makefile provided here creates a library file
objects/sys/libwxme.a. 'make edjr' creates the demo executeable 'edjr'
(Ed Jr.).
